==> Pouring icu4c-64.2.mojave.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
icu4c is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides libicucore.dylib (but nothing else).

If you need to have icu4c first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/icu4c/sbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find icu4c you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/icu4c/include"
          brew unlink icu4c && brew link icu4c –force
Unlinking /usr/local/Cellar/icu4c/64.2... 0 symlinks removed
